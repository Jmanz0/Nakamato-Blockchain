# Nakamato-Blockchain
Designed and implemented a blockchain system adhering to the Nakamoto (Bitcoin) protocol, focusing on distributed systems and cryptographic principles. The project includes a client-miner architecture to enable secure transactions, decentralized consensus, and efficient communication between peers.

Features
- Client: RPC-based program to submit transactions to miners.
- Miner: Validates transactions, resolves forks, applies the longest chain rule, and mines blocks with adjustable Proof-of-Work difficulty.
- Networking: Static peer list for transaction and block broadcasting.
